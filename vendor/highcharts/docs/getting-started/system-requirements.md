System requirements
===

Highcharts is solely based on native browser technologies and doesn't require client side plugins like Flash or Java. Furthermore you don't need to install anything on your server. No PHP or ASP.NET. Highcharts needs only the highcharts.js core to run.

HighchartsÂ works in all modern browsers including mobile devices and Internet Explorer from version 6. Standard browsers use [SVG](https://www.w3.org/Graphics/SVG/) for the graphics rendering. In legacy Internet Explorer (IE8 and before) graphics are drawn using [VML](https://www.w3.org/TR/NOTE-VML).

Highcharts runs on any server that supports HTML. You can even run Highcharts locally from a filesystem, since all the rendering is done locally in a browser.

Browser compatibility
---------------------

We test our software on many browsers using the latest versions. Knowing that Internet Explorer users have a tendency not to upgrade we also systematically test older versions of that browser. Highcharts runs on the following browser versions:

|Brand|Versions supported|
|--- |--- |
|Firefox|2.0 +|
|Chrome|1.0 +|
|Safari|4.0 +|
|Opera|9.0 +|
|Edge|12.0 +|
|Internet Explorer|6.0-8.0 partial support using polyfills|
|Internet Explorer|9.0 +|
|Android Browser|3.0 +|

Supporting IE 6-8
-----------------

For supporting IE 6-8, some polyfills are needed. The first file, `oldie-polyfills.js` includes some common array functions. This file extends array and object prototypes, and can be omitted if you have other polyfill libraries, or prefer to use your own. The second file, `oldie.js`, includes the VML renderer since old IE doesn't support SVG rendering. The polyfills must be inluded before the Highcharts main file. With conditional comments, it looks like this:

```html
    <!--[if lt IE 9]>
    <script src="https://code.highcharts.com/modules/oldie-polyfills.js"></script>
    <![endif]-->
    <script src="https://code.highcharts.com/highcharts.js"></script>
    <!--[if lt IE 9]>
    <script src="https://code.highcharts.com/modules/oldie.js"></script>
    <![endif]-->
```
